# ARP Cache Poisoning Using Scapy

* *Working* 

**(Note: Enable IP Forwading On Your Device Before Using The Program)**

This program uses the scapy module to forge and send fake ARP Packets between the gateway and the target device.
Once the attack is running between the two devices, use a tool like wireshark to intercept the traffic coming in your device.
